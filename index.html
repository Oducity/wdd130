            <p>My namwe is Odumamwen Evans Henry Aisiokuebor and you can call me Oducity for short. I am from Benin city, Edo state, Nigeria.
                I love programming and I have been a self learner until I got the opportunity to learn at ByuPathWay worldwide. Before I started learning to code, I have been self-employed
                and I found Unicon Aluminum Company, Unicon Solar Solutions, Unicon Bio-Digester and Unicon Estate Development. Currently, I aim to be one of the best in software development
                and use it to support companies and solve real world problems.
